The files here were created using the files at https://www.spriters-resource.com/snes/supersf2
The copied content in this folder is a tiny fraction (perhaps 1% or less) of the Street Fighter
images and are being used for educational purposes (a course in programming) and it is
not possible to construct an entire game using the few files in this folder.

All it is possible to do with these few files is demonstrate how to animate a character.

It is believed that this usage is covered under fair use, but the files will be removed if
requested by the rights-holder.
